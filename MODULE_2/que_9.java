//que-9-->â€¢ Create a class to print the area of a square and a rectangle. The class has two
//methods with the same name but different number of parameters. The method
//for printing area of a rectangle has two parameters which are length and
//breadth respectively while the other method for printing area of square has
//one parameter which is side of square.
